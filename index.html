  <h2>The basics of the <b>Web</b> and <b>HTML</b></h2>
  <div class="section">
        <p>
          The <b>Web</b> is a collection of documents.<br>
		          It's sort of like a library. It can keep lots of different things:text, pictures, videos, etc. <br>
		          But the biggest part of the web is <b>HTML</b>.
        </p>

	        <p>
		          <b>HTML</b> is a language that tells the computer how to show all the things on the web. <br>
          		One way to think about it is to imagine HTML is a hi-tech display case.<br>
		          It doesn't permanently change the thing you are showing, it just lets you look at it in a different way.<br>
		          For example, look at these items in their display cases:
	        </p>
	          <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Museum_display_cases-4_glass_sides_display_case_副本.jpg" alt="items in display cases">
  	      <p>
		          Imagine you could shine a light on the cases to emphasize the contents within.<br>
		          You could slant the cases to the side so we'd have to look at them on an angle.<br> 
		          You could move the middle case to the end so it's in a different position, or move them away from each other so there are big spaces in between each case.<br>
		          These hi-tech cases even have zoom lenses to make everything inside look bigger or smaller.<br>
          		But remember, you can always take the item out of the case and it's back to its original state. Then you can put it in a new case to make it look different all over again!
	        </p>
        	<p>	
		          These hi-tech display cases can even show things or bring things that are located in a different case somewhere in the world.<br>
		          And most amazingly, certain display cases can even bring you to a different room of display cases if you touch it.<br>
		          We call these special connections references and <em>hyperlinks</em>.<br>
	        </p>
	        <p>
		          This is what HTML does to all the text, pictures, videos, etc on the web.<br>
		          All of these things need display cases to show them correctly on the web, so as you can imagine that there is a lot of HTML on the web.
	        </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Communicating in <b>HTML</b></h2>
  <div class="section">
        <p>
        	  Like all languages, HTML has a vocabulary. And HTML uses this vocabulary to tell the computer how to show things.<br> 
          	And for some things, we tell the computer to start showing something a certain way, but we also need to tell the computer to stop showing it a certain way.<br>
          Energizer bunny on a perpetual motion battery.<br>
    	      So we have to be sensitive to how the computer understands HTML. It requires a little different thinking than English or even talking to humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vocabulary of HTML doesn't use words, it uses <em>tags</em>. These are sets of symbols that tell a computer to show something, for example, as<br>
        	  <em>emphasized</em><br>
          	<b>bold</b><br>
          	or even<br>
          	<br>
    	      spaced<br>
          	<br>
    	      apart.<br>
    	      When we combine these symbols with the thing we want to show, it''s an <em>element</em><br>
    	      Elements can also be either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine writing a school essay or notes on a piece of ruled paper. We usualy write across the page, staying on one line until we run out of room.<br>
          	Then we go to the next line and keep writing across until we run out of page.<br>
          	Sometimes are sentences are short so we don't have to go all the way to the end of the page.<br>
          	But we still start the next sentence on the next line at the beginning and go until we run out of room or don't need anyore room. Then we go to the next line.<br>
    	      HTML Inline Elements are similar becase they like to stick to the lines.<br>
          	But Block Elements don't stick to the lines. They stick to boxes.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        	Think about this picture:
        </p>
        <img src="http://orientation.ucsc.edu/admissions-copy/orientation/resource-guide/images/notes2.jpg?t=0" alt="notepaper divided into sections">
        <p>
          	If you were taking notes using this paper, would you start writing info in the "cue" section and just write all the way across into the "lecture notes" section?<br> 
    	      No, you would get to the line and move your pen back to the left edge of the page before writing any more. The lecture section is for different info.<br>
    	      So block elements are sort of like this, they stay in their boxes, even if we can't visibly see the boxes in our HTML or on the webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          	HTML has a lot of tags and elements we can use so we can find a lot of different ways to show all the stuff on the web!
        </p>
  </div>

  <h2><b>Creating a Structured Document</b></h2>
  <div class="section">
	        <p>
		          HTML is like the layout of a house. But people just don't want to live in blank houses, even if they are constructed nicely. They also want style.<br>
		          This is what <b>CSS</b> does. It gives style to a document. CSS may see confusing, but really, it's just another language with a syntax, just like HTML. It just has a different method to a similar goal - Make a great webpage.<br>
          		Additionally, you can use <em>JavaScript</em> to add interactivity to the house.
	        </p>
	        <p>
            So how does this all get put together?<br>
		            We have all these cool tools - HTML, CSS, JavaScript. How do they work together? Well, like any good team, they need to have some rules and structure to guide them to their goal.
	        </p>
	        <p>
		          HTML and CSS work together in a <b>Box-like structure</b>. Everything on the page goes in a box, even if it's not blatantly visible when first glancing at a page. Even round things fit into a space of a box.
        	</p>
        	<p>
		          It may seem like it's a limiting structure, but in fact, it still has many possibilities.<br>
		          In a webpage, the boxes can go inside other boxes. Like Russian Dolls.<br>
          		When we put boxes inside boxes, then we arrange the code in a Tree structure, so we don't get confused. It sort of look like a sideways tree, actually. Little triangles represent the branches or elements of the tree.<br>
		          We can show the division of the boxes using the "div" and "/div" tags. And remember, boxes can go within boxes.
	         </p>
    </div>

  <h2><b>Adding CSS Style</b></h2>
  <div class="section">
  	  <p>
		      We can use CSS to add style to our HTML in a very efficient way. We can type CSS to apply styles to different areas in just a few instructions. So it can be very easy.
	    </p>
	    <p> 
      Imagine you live in a house and want to turn certain lights on every night when it gets dark. You could go to each room and turn on the light individually. Or you could put in a special remote control to turn all the lights on in certain rooms in just one command.
	    </p>
	    <p>
      CSS is like this. You can make all your pictures have a pink box around them by saying one time, "put a pink box around anything that is labeled a picture", instead of having to go to each picture and write code to tell it to have a pink box around it.
    	</p>
	    <p>
      This also reflects an important mantra in computing and programming: <em>Don't Repeat Yourself</em><br>
		            The more duplicate instructions you have, the easier it is for you to make a mistake or have something go wrong, and it can be difficult to cleanly delete the instructions. Like Orphan Black.
    </p>
    	<p>
          		To enter CSS into an HTML file, you can insert it into the HTML code or write a separate file that you connect to the HTML file. You'll have to decide for yourself which is best for your project since it can depend.<br>
		          CSS then uses <em>selectors</em> which are used similar to the way tags are used in HTML.<br>
          		When you enter CSS into your HTML, remember, it will affect everything that you mark to be affected by that particular CSS <em><b>and</b></em> if you have more than one CSS selector affecting something at a time, the <em>most specific</em> applies.
	     </p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>The Box Model and Style</h2>
  <div class="section">
	    <p>
		      The Box model is an important concept to remember. All items in a web page fit into boxes, and boxes can fit inside of boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      	When we look at giving style to our web page, our boxes can have style too.<br>
    	  The box can be made of four parts:<br> Margin, Border, Padding, and Content.<br>
    	  Content is whatever the main stuff of a box is - a picture, text, etc.<br>
      	The Padding goes arond the content, to give it a little space.<br>
    	  The Border goes around the padding and content.<br>
    	  And the Margin keeps your 3-layer box away from other boxes and gives them some space. It has no color.
     </p>
  </div>

  <h2>WoWoWoWOWoWoWoW</h2>
  <div class="section">
     <p>
		      Wow, I did it. I feel great! I never did CSS before and here I did it! I even was reading an article* about CSS patterns and not only did I understand where to put the CSS, I also understood how to change it to how I wanted it. GOOD JOB ME.
